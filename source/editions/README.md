Editions 0.1.1
==============

Editions is a simple theme for [Datenstrom Yellow](https://datenstrom.se/yellow/) using [Croissant](https://github.com/yomli/croissant/). It is in use here: <https://editions.yom.li/>

## How to customise a theme

All theme files are stored in your `system/themes` folder. All layout files are stored in your `system/layouts` folder. You can edit these files. Your changes will not be overwritten when the website is updated. You may need to translate some labels (from French).

## Installation

[Download extension](https://github.com/yomli/yellow-extensions/raw/main/zip/editions.zip) and copy zip file into your `system/extensions` folder. Right click if you use Safari.

Copy all files located in [manual](./manual/) to the root of your website. Yellow can't copy those files by itself.
